# 🌐 FastAPI Comprehensive API Development Project

Welcome to my journey of building a **complete, industry-ready API** with Python and FastAPI! This project was a tremendous learning experience, providing me with the opportunity to deepen my skills in API development and master a full suite of essential tools and best practices.

---

## 📚 Project Overview

Through this project, I worked extensively with **FastAPI** to design and build a robust, production-grade API. I dove into essential API principles like route management, data serialization, schema validation, and model structuring. Alongside mastering FastAPI, I developed proficiency in managing databases with **PostgreSQL** and **SQLAlchemy** ORM, and I learned how to ensure code quality and reliability through thorough **testing with Pytest**.

This project also introduced me to **CI/CD pipelines** with GitHub Actions, enabling automated testing and deployment workflows that are essential for modern development. Integrating tools like Docker for containerization and deploying to cloud platforms further enhanced my understanding of how to build scalable, secure, and high-performing APIs in real-world scenarios.



### 🚀 Technologies and Tools

- **FastAPI** - Framework for high-performance APIs
- **PostgreSQL** - Relational database management
- **Postman** - API testing and debugging tool to validate endpoints 
- **SQLAlchemy** - ORM to handle database interaction
- **Alembic** - Database migrations
- **JWT** - Secure authentication with JSON Web Tokens
- **Docker & Docker Compose** - Containerization
- **Pytest** - Automated testing
- **GitHub Actions** - CI/CD automation

📜 FastAPI Essentials
Starting FastAPI and Route Creation

    Path Operations: Create basic routes for various CRUD operations.
    HTTP Requests: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE methods.

Schema Validation & CRUD Operations

    Pydantic Models: Schema validation for requests and responses.
    CRUD Operations: Implementing Create, Read, Update, Delete.

💾 Database Integration
PostgreSQL Setup & SQLAlchemy ORM

    PostgreSQL Installation: Step-by-step installation for Windows/Mac.
    Database Management: Setting up and querying using SQL.
    SQLAlchemy: Connecting to PostgreSQL and managing models and relationships.

python

## 🧪 Postman API Testing

Throughout this project, I used **Postman** to interact with and test my API endpoints. Postman allowed me to validate the API’s functionality at each stage, ensuring responses matched expectations and that each endpoint worked as intended. Key tasks included:

- **Creating and managing collections** for API requests
- **Organizing requests** for different routes (CRUD operations, authentication, etc.)
- **Testing endpoints** with various data inputs
- **Saving requests** to streamline the testing process and ensure consistency

# Example model with SQLAlchemy
from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String
from database import Base

class Item(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'items'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, index=True)
    description = Column(String, index=True)

Migrations with Alembic

    Database migration best practices with Alembic.

bash

# Initialize Alembic and create migrations
alembic init alembic
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Initial migration"
alembic upgrade head

🔒 Authentication
JWT Token & OAuth2

    JWT Authentication: Secure your endpoints with JWT tokens.
    OAuth2 Password Flow: Simplify user authentication.

User Management

    User Registration and Login: Implementing user routes and password hashing for secure storage.

🚀 Deployment
Hosting with Heroku and NGINX

    Heroku: Deploying the API to a production environment.
    NGINX: Configuring for reverse proxy and enabling SSL.

Continuous Deployment with GitHub Actions

    CI/CD Pipeline: Automate deployment and testing with GitHub Actions.
    Environment Variables: Secure and manage production environment variables.

🐋 Docker
Docker & Docker Compose

    Dockerfile: Containerize the FastAPI app for production.
    Docker Compose: Manage multi-container applications.

dockerfile

# Example Dockerfile for FastAPI
FROM python:3.9
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
CMD ["uvicorn", "app.main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "80"]

🧪 Testing & CI/CD
Writing Unit Tests with Pytest

    Pytest: Writing unit tests to verify functionality.
    Test Fixtures: Setup and teardown of test environments.

python

# Example pytest function
def test_create_user(client):
    response = client.post("/users/", json={"username": "testuser", "password": "testpass"})
    assert response.status_code == 200

Continuous Integration

    GitHub Actions: Automate testing, building, and deploying on code push.
